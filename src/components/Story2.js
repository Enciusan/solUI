              The wind has died down, no longer whipping snow into Sai&rsquo;s
              eyes. The view is clear and he spots several dark figures in the
              distance, slowly growing closer. Undoubtedly Man. Hunters of their
              kind. Killing them for their fur, reducing their numbers for
              vanity. We&rsquo;ll show them. Sai plans with the other foxes,
              knowing this is their only chance for survival.

              The foxes know the land best and they blend in with the snow and
              the rocks easily. They&rsquo;re ready and they have their numbers.
              Sai and the others decide together their strategy of attack. The
              humans were smart too and had weapons and nets, meaning the foxes
              must be careful.

              They hid, males, females, old and adolescent, all of them prepared
              and in position. Some dug holes and stayed below the snow, others
              hid in caves or behind rocks. The humans would never expect such a
              strategic maneuver.

              The wind changed again, bringing the scent of human their
              direction again. This time much stronger than before.
              They&rsquo;re getting close. The sound of their boots crunching
              the snow as they walked across the open plain towards the foxes
              dens grew louder. Once the men had passed the first den the foxes
              would attack.

              When the moment came, the others were scared. No one moved. Sai
              knew he had to be the first, so he leaped out of the snow and
              latched onto the thick gloves on the nearest man&rsquo;s hand. He
              yells out, grabbing Sai by the scruff. He thought he was dead. But
              in that moment of bravery, dozens of arctic foxes erupted from
              their hiding spots, biting, shouting and chasing the hunters.
            </div>

            <div className="flex justify-center mt-2 font-germania sm:text-xl text-lg w-8/12 text-start mx-auto">
              The men were dancing and jumping around frantically, screaming at
              the foxes and each other. Unsure of what to do, they did what
              seemed best and ran, quickly disappearing from sight as the snow
              swallowed them up.
            </div>

            <div className="flex justify-center mt-2 font-germania sm:text-xl text-lg w-8/12 text-start mx-auto">
              The foxes celebrated! They have won this battle, but would there
              be a war? Sai and his band of arctic soldiers will be prepared for
              the next time that any man decides to hunt them. After all, the
              North Pole doesn&rsquo;t just belong to humans!
